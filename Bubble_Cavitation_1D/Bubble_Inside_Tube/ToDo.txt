(1) Natural frequency  R_0 << R_v0
(2) Viscous Damping Coeff
(3) Small Pressure perturbation. p_inf0 + p_a exp(j omega t)
(4) Small Pressure step. p_inf = p_inf0 + p_a. 
    pa << p_inf0
(5) Acoustic pertubation on one side of the tube.
(6) Add compliance
(7) DNS
(8) Thermal Coupling. (Solve inside the bubble)
(9) Fow inside complaible tube
(10) In the limit R_0/R_v0 -> 0
(11) Eqb shape of a bubble inside a tube.
(12) Non uniform pressure forcing
    p(r->infty,theta) = f(theta)
(13) Flow in the tube + potential
